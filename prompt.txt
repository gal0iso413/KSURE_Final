## **Final Revised Plan: XGBoost Risk Prediction Model Development**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Understanding**

**Step 1: Simple Baseline Model**

- Load data from 1_Dataset.py output
- Basic data exploration (shape, missing values, target distribution)
- Create simplest possible XGBoost model with default parameters
- Use simple train/test split (80/20) without considering dates
- *Goal: Establish working pipeline and baseline performance*

**Step 2: Basic Evaluation Framework**

- Implement proper multi-class evaluation metrics
- Create confusion matrix visualization
- Document baseline performance for comparison
- *Goal: Understand current model performance*

**Step 3: Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ⭐ *NEW*

- **Data Quality Analysis**: Missing patterns, outliers, data types
- **Temporal Patterns**: Distribution changes over time, seasonality
- **Target Variable Analysis**: Class distribution over time, business cycles impact
- **Feature Relationships**: Correlation analysis, feature distributions by target class
- **Business Logic Validation**: Do the data patterns make business sense?
- **Data Leakage Investigation**: Identify potentially problematic features
- *Goal: Deep understanding of data characteristics to inform all subsequent decisions*

### **Phase 2: Data Strategy (Informed by EDA)**

**Step 4: Temporal Train/Test Split**

- Implement date-based splitting using insights from EDA
- Analyze temporal distribution patterns discovered in Step 3
- *Goal: Ensure model can predict future cases*

**Step 5: Class Imbalance Strategy**

- Apply imbalance handling methods based on EDA findings
- Use temporal patterns to inform resampling strategies
- *Goal: Address data imbalance systematically*

### **Phase 3: Model Optimization**

**Step 6: EDA-Informed Feature Engineering & Selection**

- Apply feature selection based on EDA insights
- Create new features if patterns suggest opportunities
- Remove problematic features identified in EDA
- *Goal: Optimize feature set for model performance*

**Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna**

- Define search space based on data characteristics
- *Goal: Find optimal model configuration*

### **Phase 4: Advanced Development** ⚡ *DECISION POINT*

> Practical Check: After Step 7, evaluate if current performance meets business needs. If yes, consider proceeding directly to Phase 6 (Analysis) rather than additional complexity.
> 

**Step 8: Model Architecture Experiments ⭐ NEW
- Test united model vs individual models
- Test ordinal classification vs regression
- Compare performance metrics
- Choose best approach based on results

**Step 9: Advanced Validation** *(If needed)*

- Implement time series cross-validation
- *Goal: Ensure robust performance*

### **Phase 5: Analysis & Interpretation**

**Step 10: Feature Importance & Interpretability**

- Generate SHAP values and business interpretations
- *Goal: Provide explainable predictions*

**Step 11: Comprehensive Visualization**

- Create business-focused visualizations
- *Goal: Generate actionable insights*

### **Phase 6: Validation & Documentation**

**Step 12: Model Validation & Testing**

- Test across multiple periods
- Validate business assumptions
- *Goal: Ensure production readiness*

**Step 13: Final Documentation & Deployment Prep**

- Document limitations and recommendations
- *Goal: Deliver production-ready model*
